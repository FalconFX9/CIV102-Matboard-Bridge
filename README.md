Matboard Bridge Simulator/Stress Calculator

Current Modules:

    -Cross-Section property calculator
        -Second moment of area calculator
        -Centroid calculator
    -Diagram function generator
        -Generates SFD and BMD
            -Curvature diagram will be added at some point
    -Cross-Section Visualizer
        -Shows cross-section at given depth (not done)
        -Show elevation view of bridge (maybe with stress color coded?)


Missing:

    -Basically all the stress calculations
    -Variable cross-section generator (for arches)
    -Deflection calculator
    -Matboard area calculator (to make sure it fits-ish)
    -Matboard piece generator (basically output templates)
